# TBFC

Tricky's BrainFuck Compiler is a simple BrainFuck to C converter.
It "compiles" Brainfuck programs to the C programming language.

This was merely some simple practise for C++ and also an experiment in how to use C++ in Visual Studio (hance the VS files in this repository)
You can just use g++ to compile TBFC.cpp if you prefer that, though. I didn't use any external stuff anyway.
